<h2 id="project_overview">‚òÅÔ∏è Project Overview</h2>

Rooted Rebllion is a 2D boss battle style game that was developed in 48 hours for Global Game Jam 2023. The theme of the jam was "Roots" and was developed using Unity. This was a two person project, developed by myself and [Abraham Khan](https://github.com/AbrahamTKhan). The aim of the game is to defeat the tree boss. The player has 2 types of attack: axe throwing and meleeing. The boss shoots branches at the player and also has an area-of-effect attack, where it shoots roots through the ground. As the tree boss loses health, it becomes more aggressive.
